# outside_lightshow
Light show controlled by sixteen relay switches. Each song will be choreographed, there is no built in preprocessor.
The whole program relies on the use of the threading module, which will alllow me to control seperate tasks at the same
time.

Program will either be made for a pi3 or a pi4, depends on which one I feel like buying
